		<description><![CDATA["An institution - in the best sense of the word. The platform this pub is built on is the barmen. We're talking real Barmen. Barmen from a time that the Tiger forgot. People who remember you, even if you haven't been in for a year. People for who the smallest nod from your seat triggers a round re-order, delivered to the table. People who are both professional, and friendly." - Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></description>

		<longitude>-6.2646</longitude>
		<description><![CDATA["I really like Hogans because, and this may take some explaining, it's really easy to use. What I mean by that is that this pub operates completely without hassle. The furniture is of the really simple, no frills, "place ass here" school and I think that has an effect on everyones mood. It's a good old school style that encourages conversation, a very positive feature in any pub." - Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></description>

Their doormen have always been very polite to me as well which is a plus (not that I look rough or owt, but sometimes theyre just bad-tempered" - Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></description>

		<longitude>-6.260785</longitude>
		<description><![CDATA["What are the unique qualities that make this particular establishment so appealing, you ask? Well, it's bar has a brass rail (VERY important, if you have ask why, well there's no use explaining it to you). There's trad music every night, they do a lovely carvery at a reasonable price and, probably most importantly for me personally, they sell Beamish. Added to this, the pub was built when pubs were laid out like proper pubs: lots of walls and little snug corners to hide away in." Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA["The Foggy Dew hosts a glut of middle aged scene rockers and punks who still barfly their old dingy pub even though it has been renovated into a modern memorabilia filled rock bar. They swing about each other in small concentric circles and it has been said that the place can be slightly off putting to new comers not familiar with the often stand off-ish cliques."

The Stag's Head doesn't do anything modern or wacky, but just has that special atmosphere of conviviality and warmth that a pub should have. Great pints in a snug friendly space with friends you didn't know before you stepped in the door." - Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></description>
